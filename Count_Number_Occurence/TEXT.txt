Simple. Create a mass driver and launch it into Earth's orbit. 
Use the potatoes as ammunition. 
Imagine the horror on the face of the UN security council as a gigantic mass of superheated tuber comes hurtling towards their HQ. 
Or, you could genetically modify the potatoes and create an army of minions. 
This will require a knowledge of advanced genetic engineering, child's play for any Mad Scientist. 
Take care though, the last time I brought vegetables to life they evolved and ran for positions in the UK Parliament.
