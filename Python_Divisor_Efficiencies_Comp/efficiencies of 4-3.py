# By using time function of the python, compare the time efficiency of the question 3
# and question 4 by giving the same two numbers to find the GCD of them. Please give
# very big numbers to be able to find the time which is suitable to compare them.
# Pease send the copy of compared timing outputs and write a conclusion in one or
# two sentence.


# Q4 input 1: 900000000
#   input 2: 567
# total time using time.clock() func : 13.519.....

# Q3 input 1: 900000000
#   input 2: 567
# total time using time.clock() func : 6.116......

# Q4 has more steps to calcuculate so that may be the reason or the Q3's algorithm is much more efficent
