# a. Write a function, Sieve of Eratosthenes as defined in chapter 1 (CH01 in lecture notes)
# by using python. Do not forget that mathematicians do not consider 1 to be a prime
# number. So output of this function should not include 1. Also, in order to able to use the
# output array of this function in the prime factorization function defined in the 2 nd part
# of the question, you have to eliminate all zero (0) values from output array.

# Hint: you may import math library and you may use math.sqrt(x) and math.floor(x)
# functions in python.

# b. Write a function, prime factorization which will find and return all the prime factors of a
# given positive integer number. This function should call and use the output of Sieve of
# Eratosthenes function while finding prime factorization of the given number.

# c. Write the main program which finds and prints two different positive integers ( letâ€™s say
# m & n) greatest common divisor by using middle school procedure as below..
# Middle-school procedure
# Step 1 Find the prime factorization of m
# Step 2 Find the prime factorization of n
# Step 3 Find all the common prime factors of this two numbers and print them.
# Step 4 Compute the product of all the common prime factors
# and print it as gcd(m,n)

# Sample Run:
# Non-negative integer >=2 please: 64
# Another Non-negative integer >=2 please: 12
# Common prime factors are: [2, 2]
# Greatest common divisor: 4
